# Repository of Software Architecture Artefacts

This repository groups artefacts used on software architecture module. This module is delivered to undergraduate students of computer science-related courses at Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, Cornélio Procópio, Brazil.  

As of this date, [Dr. Gabriel Costa Silva](http://gabrielcosta.utfpr.site) is responsible for delivering the module.

## Content

Content in this repository is organised in branches. Each branch groups a set of artefacts used in the module. This is the current content of this repository:

### App01
A single class app that stores in memory and lists names. This app is used to show fundamental principles for a good architecture;

### App02 
A desktop (Swing) app that stores in memory and lists Customers and Countries. Students develop a version of this app to use as input for software architecture activities, like creating architectural description of classes and software decomposition.

This is a maven project, thus you just need to clone, package and run, like this:

```
git clone -b App02 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2
mvn package
java -jar target/app2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### App03
This branch just adds the class architectural description to App02 maven project. The architectural description was created by using IntelliJ IDEA automatic diagram generator. 

To see the description, just go to src/main/resources

### App04
This branch adds the DAO pattern and JDBC to enable database access. In addition, layer, data and class architectural descriptions can be found in src/main/resources.

This is a maven project with Derby embedded DB. Thus you just need to clone, package and run, like this:

```
git clone -b App04 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2
mvn package
java -jar target/app2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### App05
This branch adds the business layer to the application. Note that no architectural description was updated in this branch.

This is a maven project with Derby embedded DB. Thus you just need to clone, package and run, like this:

```
git clone -b App05 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2
mvn package
java -jar target/app2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### App06
This branch takes the app to the web. This means a client-server architecture.

We used Spring boot and JPA in this project.

Thus you just need to clone and run, like this:

```
git clone -b App06 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

### App07

This branch features a REST API example by using Spring boot.

To see it in action, first clone and run the project:

```
git clone -b App07 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2

mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

Then, use a REST client tool (curl, httpie, postman) to access the endpoints. Using curl, you can:

```
curl -X GET localhost:8080/hello

curl -X POST localhost:8080/person -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Connor", "age": 14}' localhost:8080/person

curl -X PUT localhost:8080/person -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Connor", "age": 14}' localhost:8080/person
```

### App08

This branch extends App06 by enabling deleting a country.

Like previous branches, you just need to clone and run, like this:

```
git clone -b App08 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

### App09

This branch features a REST Serverless function example by using Azure functions.

Some configuration may be necessary to run it: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-java-maven

To see it in action, first clone and run the project:

```
git clone -b App09 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2

mvn clean package
mvn azure-functions:run
```

Like in the REST API, use a REST client tool (curl, httpie, postman) to access the endpoints. Using curl, you can:

```
curl -X GET <URL>

curl -X POST <URL> -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Connor", "age": 14}' 

curl -X PUT <URL> -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Connor", "age": 14}' 
```

### App10

This branch features a REST Serverless function activity by using Azure functions.

To see it in action, first clone and run the project:

```
git clone -b App10 https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/software-architecture-2018-2.git

cd software-architecture-2018-2

mvn clean package
mvn azure-functions:run
```
